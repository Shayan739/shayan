      <h3>Discover CYB3R X CRAFTS</h3>
      <p>Art is a diverse range or product of human activity that involves creative or imaginative talent
expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas.
There is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art, and ideas have changed over time.
The three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture.
Theatre, dance, and other performing arts, as well as literature, music, film and
other media such as interactive media, are included in a broader definition of the
arts. Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated
from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century
, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts
are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the
decorative or applied arts. The nature of art and related concepts, such
as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch 
of philosophy known as aesthetics.The resulting artworks are studied
in the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art.</p>

		<h4>Different types of Art</h4>
		</center>
      <p>There are countless forms of art. When it comes to visual arts, there are generally 3 types: decorative, commercial, and fine art.
The broader definition of “the arts” covers everything from painting through theatre, music, architecture,
and more. However, the visual arts are those artistic creations that we can see, like sculptures or paintings.</p>
